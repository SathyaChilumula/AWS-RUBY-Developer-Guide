    :keywords: AWS SDK for ruby code examples

`Ruby on Rails <http://rubyonrails.org/>`_ provides a web development framework for Ruby that makes
it easy to create websites with Ruby.

The |sdk-ruby| provides a gem to enable easy integration with Rails. You can use |AEBlong|, |OPSlong|,
or |ACDlong| to deploy and run your Rails applications in the AWS Cloud.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-integrating-the-sdk-ruby-with-rails:

Integrating the |sdk-ruby| with Rails
=====================================

AWS provides a gemfile, :code:`aws-sdk-rails`, that supports integration of the |sdk-ruby| with
Rails. You can view its GitHub repository at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-rails.

Add the gem to your application's Gemfile, as shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: none

    gem 'aws-sdk-rails'

The gem includes the |sdk-ruby|, so adding the gem is all you need to do to add AWS support to your
Rails application.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-ses-support-for-actionmailer:

|SES| Support for ActionMailer
==============================

When you use the :code:`aws-sdk-rails` gem in a :code:`config/environments` file of your Rails
project (for example, :file:`config/environments/production.rb`), you can use |SESlong| (|SES|) as
the back end for the :code:`ActionMailer` class, as shown in the following example.

.. code-block:: none

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :aws_sdk

For more information about :code:`ActionMailer`, see the `Action Mailer Basics
<http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html>`_ on the Ruby on Rails website.

.. _aws-ruby-sdk-logging:

Logging
=======

The :code:`aws-sdk-rails` gem configures the SDK logger to use :code:`Rails.logger`.

The gem also configures the SDK log messages to use the :code:`:info` log level. You can change the
log level by setting :code:`:log_level` in the `Aws.config
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws.html#config-class_method>`_ hash. The following
example sets the log level to :code:`:debug`.

.. code-block:: ruby

    Aws.config.update({log_level: :debug})
